# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends 
# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Create two technical analysis deliverables and written report of outcomes.
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise gather all necessary information to be prepared for her play. The comparison of other plays with their goals and pledges will help Louise plan her fundraising to be successful in her play production.

## Analysis and Challenges
One of the biggest challenges facing this analysis was entering the countifs for determining the outcomes based on goals section. Originally, I thought to filter the kickstarter data file with successful (or fails/cancelled) and plays and then enter the countifs with only the data filtered under the pledge amounts. This proved to include all of the data in the file, and I was getting thousands of successful/failed data between the top listed ranges. I then realized I also had to include each of the criterial in every set of outcomes that I needed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
With creating the above graph, the instructions in formatting, it did not lead to a clear graph. Much of my time was spent reformatting it to match the challenge 1 example.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
The most successful of outcomes was in May. Summer months of May, June and July have the best outcomes of having a successful production. The margin of success and failure in October is within 20 %. December productions seem to be around 50/50 and can either be successful or a failure. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the outcomes based on goal it seems that the production with the highest goal also have the highest failure. The most successful range is above 1000 and less than 5000. The lowest success is between ranges of 45000-49999. It is surprising to see the success dip low for ranges of 25000-34000 and increase drastically in success between 35000-44999 and take a drastic decline following. The outcomes show that if the goal is less then Louisa should probably aim less than 5000. If she has a high goal, then she should remain 35000-44999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset it very broad. The amount of information and irrelevance of a lot of it to Louise’s needs created a lot to dig through. While the information listed shows the months and $ amounts that dictated the success it is important to note that there is not a theme listed on the dataset. The success or failure could have had another recurring factor that was not noticed with only months/$ amounts being considered. Louise’s production could be in May with the desired $ amount around or less than 5000 and fail due to another factor.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
An area plot would be able to visually highlight the distances between the sets of data that we are looking at. I think it would be a beneficial graph to use in this set of data. A table that would have been useful to use is to always have compared Louise’s goal for her play/production and how it relates to each of the types of data we are comparing to it. Another table that would have been useful is the successful number of productions with the months and amounts together, also in comparison to Louise’s goals.
